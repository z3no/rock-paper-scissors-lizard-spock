### Thoughts about this exercise
***

At this part of the education, I feel like if I see the code, read it at my pace I understand what is happening. But I'm still not comfortable enough to fully code it out of my head.
I see that the functions I used can be written down in a shorter way, I will fix this when I return to the exercise.
When I'm working on it, I do get a feeling that I don't want to stop until I have found a good solution to make everything work, it's kind of addicting.
So that's a positive point in my opinion that I do want to keep on trying until I make that certain click, and can use what I've learned into a next challenge.

For today I put this exercise on hold and wanted to start on another game. I will come back to this one, probably during the weekend.
